# Swadit
A visual editor for Swagger files ([Demo](https://swadit.misc-net.de)).

## Prepare

Althought Swadit is only run within a browser, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org) to install all dependencies:
```
npm install -g bower
npm install
bower install
```

## Run
Swadit can either be run from a web server (simply throw all files on a web space) or locally with [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/).
